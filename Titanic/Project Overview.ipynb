    "### Problem\n",
    "On April 15th, 1912 the RMS Titanic hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York, New York. The disaster claimed approximately 1,500 lives while 710 survived. How can we predict whether a passenger died on the RMS Titanic  using passenger data including demographics, fare, cabin, embarkation, and ticket information?"

    "### Approach\n",
    "The Titanic was the largest ocean liner to enter service at the time and included numerous luxury amentities for upper-class passengers. The ship also transported many poor immigrants seeking to begin a new life in America.\n",

    "### Goal\n",
    "Develop two models that predict whether a passenger of the RMS Titanic survived. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first model should give maximum interpretability of features while achieving an out-of-sample prediction accuracy of no less than 25% lower than the top model. This model is intended to allow for comparison of other historical maritime accidents to validate the importance of different passenger features. \n",
    "- The second model should give the highest out-of-sample prediction accuracy. This model is intended to be used to predict future maritime accident severity."
